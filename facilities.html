                <h3><b>Our Facilities</b></h3>
                <p>The hotel industry is more broadly related to the hospitality industry but has a specific focus. This industry is
                concerned with meeting the needs of consumers who need accommodation overnight or longer. According to the Hotel
                Openings Worldwide Report by Statista, the total number of hotel openings in 2024 is forecasted to be 2,707.
                
                It’s a huge industry, covering everything from cozy bed-and-breakfasts to the biggest and most extravagant luxury
                resorts. Hotels, motels, hostels, spas, holiday villas, and short-term apartment rentals form part of the hotel
                industry. The industry is global in scale and generates enormous amounts of economic activity, not just within the hotel
                industry itself but for many other related sectors.
                    Hotel facilities” typically describe utilities or areas designated to facilitate an activity. This can include things
                like bars and restaurants and also covers swimming pools, tennis courts, spas, and conference rooms. The kinds of
                facilities a hotel offers will depend on the needs of its clientele and the market segment it addresses.</p>
